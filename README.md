T# hello-world-

I am Zero, a Police Officer from Brazil who is a programer in my spare time.
So i started with Python, and had some fun creating small programs to help me in my studies. 
The fun thing is, what made me turn to Java was, that i needed a remote control for my Tv.
In fact the avaliable apps aren't enough for me. Belive or not, they had no button to acess Netflix directly so i decided to learn and make my own remote control app.

and now i'm here, kinda addicted on this.

TY for reading this, i know it is a lot of nonsense :D
